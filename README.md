Overview

This project focuses on enhancing images using convolution matrices. Convolution matrices, also known as kernel matrices, are applied to images to perform operations such as sharpening, blurring, or edge detection. In this project, we utilize convolution matrices to sharpen images and improve their overall clarity.
Features

    Image Sharpening: The project applies convolution matrices to sharpen images, bringing out finer details and improving overall visual quality.

Technologies Used

    Python: The primary programming language used for implementing the image enhancement algorithms.

    OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library): Utilized for loading, processing, and analyzing images.

    Matplotlib: Employed for visualizing images and results during the development and testing phase.
